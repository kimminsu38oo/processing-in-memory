Simulating Row Clone from Row 0 to Row 3
Initial state:
Memory Array:
Row 0: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 
Row 1: 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Row 2: 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 
Row 3: 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 
Row 4: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 
Row 5: 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 
Row 6: 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 
Row 7: 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 

Row Buffer: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

Step 1: Activating Row 0 and transferring to buffer
Data transferred to buffer

Step 2: Activating Row 3 and transferring from buffer
Data transferred from buffer to Row 3

Final state:
Memory Array:
Row 0: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 
Row 1: 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Row 2: 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 
Row 3: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 
Row 4: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 
Row 5: 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 
Row 6: 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 
Row 7: 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 

Row Buffer: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 

-----------------------------

The results demonstrate that ROW CLONE significantly enhances memory performance through:

Zero memory bus utilization, as data transfer occurs internally
Low memory bandwidth consumption due to in-memory operation
No cache pollution since the operation bypasses the cache hierarchy
No unwanted data movement across the memory subsystem
Significantly reduced latency through direct row buffer utilization

In conclusion, ROW CLONE achieves substantial performance optimization by performing copy operations entirely within memory, 
eliminating system resource overhead and traditional memory hierarchy bottlenecks.
